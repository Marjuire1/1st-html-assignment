      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        I have always had an interest in Software Engineering. I previously
        ventured into bootcamps like Shecodes, a coding platform to enable young
        girls and women thrive in Frontend Engineering. I got a scholarship but
        I was not able to carry on with the program due to certain technical and
        unforeseen difficulties but that did not stop my interest in coding. I
        received online lessons from play store applications like Coursera and
        practiced during my free time from the University. I heard about ALT
        School Africa from my elder sister who is also involved in STEM. It
        piqued my interest and I decided to apply for the KIKI MORDI Scholarship
        amongst others. I got a 50% scholarship offer after scoring 90% in the
        entrance examination. I attended all the onboarding online meetings
        which gave me a wonderful insight to what my ALT School experience would
        be and I would love to give it my best. My goal for this coding course
        would be to learn everything I can possibly learn to enhance my
        understanding of web development and make money in the future ofcourse.
